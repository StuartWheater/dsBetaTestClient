\title{ds.dataFrameFill calling dataFrameFillDS}
\usage{
ds.dataFrameFill(df.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.name}{a character string representing the name of the input data frame that will be
filled with extra columns with missing values if a number of variables is missing from it
compared to the data frames of the other studies used in the analysis.}

\item{newobj}{a character string providing a name for the output data frame which defaults to
the name of the input data frame with the suffix "_filled" if no name is specified.}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal objects to use. If the \code{datasources}
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function ds.setDefaultOpals.}
}
\value{
The object specified by the \code{newobj} argument which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned indicating whether the \code{newobj} has been
created in each data source and if so whether it is in a valid form.
}
\description{
Adds extra columns with missing values in a dataframe one for each variable is not
included in the dataframe but is included in the relevant datafram of another datasource.
}
\details{
This function checks if the input data frames have the same variables (i.e. the same
column names) in all of the used studies. When a study does not have some of the variables, the
function generates those variables as vectors of missing values and combines them as columns to
the input data frame. Then, the "complete" in terms of the columns dataframe is saved in each
server with a name specified by the argument \code{newobj}.
